> A rendition of the popular game Battleship purely in the terminal, written with Python.

This was a project that I worked on for a few lessons of school time during Year 10, which has since been abandoned. The global leaderboards have broken, as the [jsonblob](https://jsonblob.com/) was removed as it has not been accessed in 30 days. One day I may resuscitate it, but it is not a priority.
